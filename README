== Sample Twitter client Application

This is a sample application which aims to integrate a Rails3 application with Twitter,
store twits on a MongoDB instance and show stored twits on a simple page.

== Install

The application requires a running MongoDB instance. MongoDB installation
instructions can be found on http://www.mongodb.org.

Also, it is required that the Rails3 gems are already installed on the
environment. Installation instructions can be found on http://rubyonrails.org/download.

After that, on the application root directory, run the 'bundle' command
so that Bundler install the required gems.

== Usage

To run the application, execute the command 'rails s' on the application
root directory. This will start the application on http://localhost:3000.

The main page shows a list of the latest twits stored on the local database.

To read a random list of twits from Twitter and store them on the database,
run the command 'rake twitter:fetch'. After that, reload the web page and
a list of twits should appear.
